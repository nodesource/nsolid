# Support

N|Solid contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a currently supported version of
N|Solid, which follows the same schedule from [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [NodeSource Website](https://nodesource.com/), especially the
  [Documentation site](https://docs.nodesource.com/)
* [Open or closed issues in the N|Solid GitHub repository](https://github.com/nodesource/nsolid/issues)
* [Questions tagged 'nsolid' on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nsolid)

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.

The open-source license grants you the freedom to use N|Solid. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage
your expectations.
